## Booking

Student members of UC Jazz perform at many on and off campus events throughout the year, mostly in small ensembles such as a trio or quartet. We welcome the opportunity to offer our students more chances to perform. For more information, contact Director Ted Moore through the contact form below.

## Support UC Jazz

UC Jazz is the main outlet on the UC Berkeley campus for jazz instruction and performance, with a long, 40-year tradition of excellence. Currently, UC Jazz has a Director and five part-time faculty members who coach the seven combos and big band. In addition to the world-class instruction, many on and off campus performance opportunities are offered to students each semester. Weekly rehearsals prepare the ensembles for end of the semester concerts and practice facilities are also provided to students.
In order to provide these services, our members require facilities, teaching materials, sheet music, instruments, studio equipment, and listening material for our Duke Ellington Memorial Library, all of which require support from individuals, businesses, and foundations who value jazz education and performance at UC Berkeley. Your contribution to the University of California Jazz Ensembles, regardless of size, is greatly needed and appreciated.

To make a contribution, please contact Director Ted Moore through the contact form below; make a check payable to UC Regents and send to the address below; or make a secure online donation using your credit card at <a href="https://give.berkeley.edu/browse/?u=108">Give to Cal</a>.
