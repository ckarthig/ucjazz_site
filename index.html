								<h2>Welcome to UC Jazz</h2>
								<p>Currently, UC Jazz consists of multiple combos, ranging in size from 3 to 8 musicians. The combos are divided into Intermediate and Advanced categories. Auditions for everyone are held at the beginning of every fall semester. UC Jazz provides rehearsal space, also available for individual use by UCJ students, for music and non-music majors, as well as for undergrad and graduate students.</p>

								<p>The combos cover a wide range of repertoire and styles and much emphasis is placed on how to perform in an ensemble. Ensembles meet weekly, and along with our annual Fall and Spring concerts, UC Jazz students perform in over 40 events per year on and off campus. Student arrangements and compositions are always encouraged.</p>
